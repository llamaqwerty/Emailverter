# Emailverter
A little project I was working on for myself but then decided to share it publicly. This Python program allows you to convert emails in raw form into simple PDFs with the email, fully formatted images, and that's it. This was made with AI so if you want some improvements, just fork it and code whatever.

It's a super simple and small yet working script and that's why I like it and hope you do, too!

## Emailverter Tutorial

For the script to work, you will need the program Python (at least version 3.7) and the Python packages [fpdf](https://pypi.org/project/fpdf/) and [Pillow](https://pythonexamples.org/python-pip-install-pillow/) which can both be installed with pip. It works with Windows 11, 10, and 7. I'm pretty sure it doesn't work on MacOS or Linux but I can't be sure.

Run the command `py <location of emailverter.py>`, replace the text in the brackets with the actual location of `emailverter.py` on your computer
